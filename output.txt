$35.4 trillion, China with $26.4 trillion, and India with $7.1 trillion will be the top three economies by 
CY2030, accounting for 47% of the world economy.  
Exhibit 1: Nominal GDP ($ Trillion), Global, CY2019 -CY2030f  
 
e: estimates; f: forecasts. Sources: International Monetary Fund (IMF), Frost & Sullivan  
In the near -term, Frost & Sullivan expects global real GDP growth to soften to 2.6% in CY2024, 
compared to 3.0% in CY2023. This will be linked to the impact of inflationary pressures and tight credit conditions on demand. Additionally, exogeneous shocks fr om sustained supply chain disruptions, 
multiple geopolitical conflicts, and extreme climate change incidents could continue to exert upward price pressures. Advanced economies are expected to grow by 1.0%, while emerging economies are set 
to grow by 3.8% i n CY2024. As advanced economies see subdued growth in CY2024 and possibly 
CY2025, Asia Pacific nations like India, the Philippines, and Vietnam along with Gulf Cooperation 
Council nations such as Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates will emer ge as near -term 
growth frontrunners.

COMPETITION  
The chauffeur driven mobility industry is heavily influenced by the overall economic conditions of a country or region. When the economy is strong, people and corporates are more likely to travel for business or leisure, leading to increased demand f or 
chauffeured car rentals. Conversely, during an economic downturn, people and corporates may cut back on travel, resulting in 
lower demand for chauffeured car rentals.  
We compete with large corporations to small, local businesses, including both the organised and unorganised sectors. The corporate mobility market is fragmented with numerous small, localized players, leading to inconsistencies in service quality , 
scalability challenges, and limited bargaining power with corporate clients. ( Source: F&S Report )  
Further, we face competition from other mobility solutions like public transportation, ride -hailing, self -drive car rental etc. 
(Source: F&S Report ) The emergence of bike -sharing and e -rickshaws further adds to the competitive landscape. (Source: F&S 
Report ) We believe that our ability to compete effectively is primarily dependent on ensuring consistent service quality and 
timely services at competitive prices, availability of specific vehicles that comprehensively meet a variety of customers’ ne eds, 
thereb y strengthening our brand over the years. We also believe that passenger mobility solutions evolve with demand, customer 
needs and government initiatives.

2.18 Provisions and contingent liabilities 
 
1. Provisions 
 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount of the obligation. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of any 
reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, 
when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time 
is recognised as a finance cost. 
 
2. Contingent liabilities 
 
Contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events and the existence of which will be confirmed only by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one are more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group, or is a present 
obligation that arises from past event but is not recognised because either it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, or a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation cannot be made. The 
Group does not recognize a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the consolidated financial statements unless the 
probability of outflow of resources is remote. 
 
3. Contingent assets 
 
Contingent assets are not recognized. However, when the realization of income is virtually certain, then the related asset is no longer 
a contingent asset, but it is recognized as an asset . 
 
Provisions, contingent liabilities, contingent assets and commitments are reviewed at each balance sheet date. 
 
2.19 Financial instruments 
 
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of 
another entity. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through 
statement of profit and loss are recognised immediately in statement of profit and loss. 
 
1. Financial assets 
 
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through statement 
of profit and loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Purchases or sales of financial assets 
that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market-place (regular way trades) 
are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. 
 
a. Classification and subsequent measurement:   
Debt instruments that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at amortised cost less impairment loss (except for 
debt investments that are designated as at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition) (i) the asset is held within a business 
model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and (ii) the contractual terms of the instrument give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

indicator of our operating performance, liquidity, profitability or cash flows generated by operating, investing or financing activities derived in accordance with Ind AS, Indian GAAP, or IFRS. In addition, these Non -GAAP Measures are not a

OVERVIEW  
We are the largest and most profitable chauffeur driven mobility provider to corporates in India, in terms of revenue from 
operations and profit after tax for Fiscal 2023 ( Source: F&S Report ). We are primarily engaged in the business of providing 
chauffeured car rentals (“ CCR ”) and employee transportation services (“ETS ”) and have been providing these services to 
corporate customers, including Fortune 500 companies in India, for more than 25 years. In Fiscal 2024, we provided CCR and 
ETS to 42 Fortune 500 c ompanies and 60 BSE 500 companies, among others, in India. The CCR segment is a B2B2C business, 
where our customers are corporate companies, and the end consumer is an employee, client, guest or visitor of these corporate  
companies. Through our ETS segment , we offer customers with solutions to manage their employee home -office -home ground 
transportation. As of September 30, 2023, we have a pan -India presence in 109 cities through our own vehicles and vendors, 
spread across 21 states and four union territori es in India which underscores our deep rooted and extensive footprint and 
demonstrates our penetration into diverse regions across India. In Fiscal 2023, we serviced the CCR and ETS requirements of 
more than 750 corporate customers in India.  In Fiscal 2023, through our CCR and ETS segments, we have completed more 
than 2,100,000 trips averaging at more than 5,700 trips in a day. We also address the global car rental requirements of our 
corporate customers, through our global network of vendors with our capability of providing CCR services in over 30 countries. 
We also provide cars of self -drive basis in the cities of Delhi, Gurugram, Mumbai and Bengaluru. We have also provided self -
drive cars outside India through vendors.  Risk Factors”,  beginning on pages 132 and 25. Set 
forth below is a discussion of certain factors that we believe may be expected to have a significant effect on our financial 
condition and results of operations:  
Relationship with our customers and dependence on certain industries.  
We have, through two and a half decades of business operations, established long -term relationships with customers across 
industries which we cater to. We provide our services to our customers operating in a range of industries including informati on 
techno logy, business process outsourcing, consultancy, healthcare, e -commerce, pharmaceutical, legal and manufacturing. We 
believe that our ability to address the transportation requirements of our customers over long periods, our dedicated service  and 
our opera tional excellence and processes to ensure high quality levels has enabled us to acquire new customers. As result, we 
have a history of high customer retention and have been providing our services to certain customers for over a decade. Such long-term association with our customers offers us significant competitive advantages such as revenue visibility, industry 
goodwill and a deep understanding of the requirements of our customers. The customers with who we share a long -standing 
relationship also contribute  significantly to our revenue. In the six months ended September 30, 2023 and Fiscal 2023, Fiscal 
2022 and Fiscal 2021, our revenue generated from customers with whom we have had a relationship of more than five years amounted to ₹ 1,607.37 million, ₹2,312.57 million, ₹561.19 million and ₹354.88 million, respectively, which contributed 
59.86%, 54.71%, 38.09% and 34.19% to our revenue from operations from the respective period. Further, in the six months 
ended September 30, 2023, Fiscal 2023, Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, we generated ₹ 2,517.61 million, ₹3,597.34 million, 
₹1,227.41 million and ₹920.10 million, respectively from our retained customers, which amounted to 93.76%, 85.11%, 83.30% and 88.63% of our revenue from operations from the respective periods.  
Our long -standing relationship with customers also offers an opportunity to cross sell our services to customers who are 
currently not availing such additional services. In the six months ended September 30, 2023, Fiscal 2023, Fiscal 2022 and Fis cal 
2021, 66.20%, 63.33%,62.00% and 47.17% of our ETS customers also availed our CCR services. Such cross selling of services 
reduces our marketing cost and cost of customer acquisition.  
We derive a significant part of our revenue from major customers and expect to continue to be reliant on our major customers for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, any failure to retain these customers and/or negotiate and execute contracts with such 
customers on terms that are commercially viable, could adversely affect our business. In addition, any defaults or delays in 
payments by a major customer may have an adverse effect on business. Our reliance on a select group of customers may also 
constrain ou r ability to negotiate our arrangements.  
Our business is heavily dependent on any growth or downturn in the global capability centres (" GCC "). Accordingly, our 
business is equally dependent our ability to retain these customers and/or negotiate and execute contracts with such customer s 
on terms that are commercially viable. The financial condition of our major customers also has an impact on our business as it 
effects their ability to make timely payments. Factors adversely affecting this sector in general, or any of our customers in 
particular, c ould have a cascading adverse effect on our business.  
Failure to meet high quality standards and stringent performance requirements of our customers.  
We are primarily engaged in the business of providing chauffeured car rentals ("CCR ") and employee transportation services 
("ETS "). Given the nature of services we offer, we are measured against, high quality service standards and stringent 
specifications of our customers, provided through the agreements, statements of work and the quality standards forming part o f 
the agreements w hich we enter into with our customers. Our agreements with our corporate customers set out various standards 
which we are required to meet including the maximum age of a vehicle and maximum distance travelled by a vehicle, 
availability of first aid box and other safety equipment such as fire extinguishers and tool kits, adherence to cleanliness, having 
valid statutory documents such as instate permits, pollution under control certific ates, registration certificate and vehicle fitness 
certificate, providing a replacement vehicle in case of breakdowns and adherence to traffic rules. To meet our customers' 
expectations, we undertake certain quality checks and trainings of drivers and chau ffeurs, the appointment of an account 
manager for every customer and quick resolution of issues due to our 24x7 customer support services, among others. We ensure 
checks on all our vehicles for cleanliness, uniform, roadworthiness and statutory compliances . Our compliance team conducts 
routine vehicle maintenance and documentation. Some of our customers require background verification to be carried out for each of the drivers and chauffeurs, we have engaged third party agencies to conduct background checks on our drivers and 
chauffeurs before any person is deployed in such a role. We pride ourselves on the quality of our service.  
Our customers maintain a performance tracker wherein we are evaluated on various parameters including compliance of our 
vehicles with necessary documentation, reporting on vehicles on time, police verification and background check of the drivers , 
behaviour al issues reported in connection with the driver and number of rash driving instances reported. If our performance 
under the agreements with customers does not meet the standards prescribed by our customers, our customers are entitled to 
reduce the busines s committed by the customers or in some instances terminate the agreement. Further , if our customers or their 
employees perceive or experience a reduction in our hospitality standards, service it may affect the demand of our services.  financial Information by the Board o f Risk Factors” beginning on page
