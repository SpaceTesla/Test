Our Company’s Financial Year commences on April 1 of the immediately preceding calendar year and ends on 
March 31 of that particular calendar year. Accordingly, all references to a particular Fiscal or Financial Year are

There are significant differences between the Ind AS, the International Financial Reporting Standards issued by 
the International Accounting Standard Board  (the “ IFRS ”) and the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in 
the United States of America (the “ U.S. GAAP ”). Accordingly, the degree to which the financial information 
included in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus will provide meaningful information is entirely dependent on the 
reader’s level of familiarity with Indian accounting practices. Any reliance by pe rsons not familiar with accounting 
standards in India, the Ind AS, the Companies Act 2013 and the SEBI ICDR Regulations, on the financial 
disclosures presented in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus s hould accordingly be limited. We have not attempted 
to quantify or identify the impact of the differences between the financial data (prepared under Ind AS and

regarding such differences and their impact on our financial data included in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus.

the numbers in a column or row in certain tables may not conform exactly to the total figure given for that column Risk Factors  – We have in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus included certain non-GAAP 
financial and operational measures and certain other industry measures related to our operations and financial 
performance that may vary from any standard methodology that is applicable across the online travel industry.

comparable with financial, operational or industry related statistical information of similar nomenclature 
computed and presented by other similar companies.”   on page 49.  
 
Industry and Market Data

Segments refers to the total number of point -to-point passenger tickets booked between two cities, airports, train 
stations or bus stations, as applicable, whether or not such a ticket is part of a larger or longer itinerary. For 
example, a booking made with two passengers for a return flight consists o f four passenger segments.  The term 
passenger segment is an industry term and is different from  operating segments as per Ind AS 108 “Operating 
Segments ”.

Notes: Both basic EPS and diluted EPS have been calculated in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) 33 (earnings per 
share). The face value of Equity Shares of our Company is ₹1.  
1. The ratios have been computed as below:  
a. Basic earnings per share (₹) = Restated Net profit/loss attributable to equity shareholders / weighted average number of shar es 
outstanding during the year.  
b. Diluted earnings per share (₹) = Restated Net profit/loss attributable to equity shareholders / weighted average number of di lutive 
equity shares  
2. The weighted average basic and diluted EPS is a product of basic and diluted EPS and respective assigned weight, dividing the resultant 
by total aggregate weight.  
3. Weighted average number of equity shares is the number of equity shares outstanding at the beginning of the year adjusted by the number 
of equity shares issued during the year multiplied by the time weighting factor. The time weighting factor is the number  of days for which 
the specific shares are outstanding as a proportion of total number of days during the year.

periods, which could subject us to additional liabilities due to which our reputation and financial condition may 
be adversely affected.  
 
Confirm Ticket Online Solutions Private Limited  
Clause (vii)(a) of CARO, 2016  Financial Information – Related Party 
Transactions ” on page  377. Further, certain related party transactions undertaken by our Company constitute 
more than 10% of total transactions of similar nature undertaken by our Company in the last three Fiscals and the 
nine months ended December 31, 2023. We cannot assure you t hat such transactions in future, individually or in 
the aggregate, will always be in the best interests of our minority shareholders and will not have an adverse effect 
on our business, results  of operations, cash flows and financial condition.  
 
34. Our quarterly results may fluctuate for a variety of reasons and may not fully reflect the underlying 
performance of our business.  
 
Upon listing of the Equity Shares, our Company will be required to publish its financial results for each quarter 
of the Fiscal, in accordance with the SEBI Listing Regulations. Our quarterly financial results may fluctuate as a 
result of a variety of fact ors, many of which are outside of our control and, as a result, may not fully reflect the 
underlying performance of our business. For example, we tend to experience higher revenue from our businesses 
in certain quarters and in particular, the third and fou rth quarters of a particular Fiscal, which coincide with the 
festival season and the year -end holiday travel season for our customers. Other factors that may affect our 
quarterly financial results also include, our ability to attract new customers and cros s-sell to existing customers; 
the amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations 
and infrastructure; general economic, political, weather, industry and market conditions; changes in our pricing 
policies or those of our competitors and suppliers; the timing and success of new services and service introductions 
by us and our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of the Indian travel industry, including 
consolidation among comp etitors, customers or strategic partners. For further information, see " -Our operations 
are seasonal in nature, due to which performance of a period may not be indicative of our performance for a 
full year."  on page 59.  
  
Our quarterly operating results may therefore vary significantly in the future, and period -to-period comparisons 
of our operating results may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter may not be reliable as 
an indicator of future perfo rmance. Further, any delay in filing these quarterly results will also result in additional 
costs for us.  
 
35. We may provide guarantees to lenders on behalf of third parties, and any failure to repay such loans by 
third parties may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Financial Information. As of December 31, 2023, the Group has 
issued a corporate guarantee of ₹ 77.60 million for our Associate, FreshB us Private Limited. The guarantee has 
been extended in favour of Tata Capital Financial Services Limited. This guarantee is provided to secure 
outstanding amounts related to the lease of buses. Our contingent liabilities as a percentage of our net worth as  of 
December 31, 2023 was 1.78%. See “ - We may provide guarantees to lenders on behalf of third parties, and 
any failure to repay such loans by third parties may affect our business, results of operations and financial 
condition ” on page 48. In addition, w e cannot assure you that no additional liability will arise out of these 
proceedings. Decisions in such proceedings adverse to our interests may have an adverse effect on our business, 
results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.  
 
43. Failure to obtain or renew approvals, licenses, registrations and permits to operate our business in a timely 
manner, or at all, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of 
operations.  
 
We are required to obtain certain approvals, registrations, permissions and licenses from regulatory authorities, to 
carry out/ undertake our business which may be subject to various conditions. If we fail to obtain some or all of 
these approvals or licens es, or renewals thereof, in a timely manner or at all, or if we fail to comply with applicable 
conditions or it is claimed that we have breached any such conditions, our license or permission for carrying on a 
particular activity may be suspended or cancel led and we may not be able to carry on such activity, which could 
adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For further information on 
the nature of approvals and licenses required for our business, see “ Government and Other Approvals ” on page 
428. In addition, we have, and may need to in the future, apply for certain additional approvals, including the 
renewal of approvals, which may expire from time to time. For details in relation to validity of our license s and 
registrations, see “ Government and Other Approvals ” on page 428.  
 
We cannot assure you that such approvals and licenses will be granted or renewed in a timely manner or at all or 
will not be withdrawn by the relevant governmental or regulatory authorities. Failure to obtain or renew such 
approvals and licenses in a timel y manner or a withdrawal of any of our licenses or registrations would make our 
operations non -compliant with applicable laws and may result in imposition of penalties by relevant authorities, 
and may also prevent us from carrying out our business. Our lic enses and approvals are subject to various 
conditions, including periodic renewal and maintenance standards. Any actual or alleged failure on our part to 
comply with the terms and conditions of such regulatory licenses and registrations could expose us to legal action, 
compliance costs or liabilities, or could affect our ability to continue to operate at the locations or in the manner 
in which we have been operating thus far.  
 
Other Internal Risks  
 
44. We do not have any identifiable promoter in terms of the SEBI ICDR Regulations and the Companies Act  
2013.  
 
Our Company does not have any identifiable promoter in terms of the SEBI ICDR Regulations and the Companies 
Act 2013. Accordingly, the success of our business operations is dependent on our Senior Management and Key 
Managerial Personnel as well as our abil ity to attract, train and retain such employees. Further, in terms of 
Regulation 14(1) of the SEBI ICDR Regulations, there is no requirement of minimum promoter’s contribution in 
the Offer and as a result, none of the Equity Shares will be locked in for a period of 18 months pursuant to the 
Offer.  
 Risk Factors  
 
Risks Relating to India  
 
58. Political, economic or other factors that are beyond our control may have an adverse effect on our business 
and results of operations.  
 
The Indian economy and its securities markets are influenced by economic developments and volatility in 
securities markets in other countries. Adverse economic developments, such as rising fiscal or trade deficits, in 
other emerging market countries may also affect investor confidence and cause increased volatility in Indian 
securities markets and indirectly affect the Indian economy in general. Any of these factors could depress 
economic activity and restrict our access to capital, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial 
condition and results of operations  and reduce the price of our Equity Shares.  
 
We are dependent on domestic, regional and global economic and market conditions. Our performance, growth 
and market price of our Equity Shares are and will be dependent to a large extent on the health of the economy in 
which we operate. Demand for our off erings may be adversely affected by an economic downturn in domestic, 
regional and global economies. Economic growth in the countries in which we operate is affected by various 
factors including domestic consumption and savings, balance of trade movements,  namely export demand and 
movements in key imports, global economic uncertainty and liquidity crisis, volatility in exchange currency rates, 
and annual rainfall which affects agricultural production. Consequently, any future slowdown in the Indian 
economy could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Also, a change in the government 
or a change in the economic and deregulation policies could adversely affect economic conditions prevalent in 
the areas in which we operate in general and our business in particular and high rates of inflation in India could 
increase our costs without proportionately increasing our revenues, and as such decrease our operating margins.  
 
59. We may be affected by competition laws, the adverse application or interpretation of which could adversely 
affect our business.  
 
The Competition Act, 2002, of India, as amended (“ Competition Act ”), regulates practices having an appreciable 
adverse effect on competition in the relevant market in India (“ AAEC ”). Under the Competition Act, any formal 
or informal arrangement, understanding or action in concert, which causes or is likely to cause an AAEC is 
considered void and may result in the imposition of substantial monetary penalties. Further, any agreement among 
competitors which directly or indirectly involves the determination of purchase or sale prices, limits or controls 
production, supply, markets, technical development, investment or the provision of services or shares the market 
or source of production or provision of services in any manner, including by way of allocation of g eographical 
area, type of goods or services or number of customers in the relevant market or in any other similar way or 
directly or indirectly results in bid -rigging or collusive bidding is presumed to have an AAEC and is considered 
void. The Competition Act also prohibits abuse of a dominant position by any enterprise.  
 
All agreements entered into by us could be within the purview of the Competition Act. Further, the CCI has extra -
territorial powers and can investigate any agreements, abusive conduct or combination occurring outside India if 
such agreement, conduct or com bination has an AAEC in India. However, the impact of the provisions of the 
Competition Act on the agreements entered into by us cannot be predicted with certainty at this stage. However, 
since we pursue an acquisition driven growth strategy, We may be aff ected, directly or indirectly, by the 
application or interpretation of any provision of the Competition Act, or any enforcement proceedings initiated 
by the CCI, or any adverse publicity that may be generated due to scrutiny or prosecution by the CCI or if  any 
prohibition or substantial penalties are levied under the Competition Act, it would adversely affect our business, 
results of operations, cash flows and prospects.  
 
60. Changing laws, rules and regulations and legal uncertainties, including the withdrawal of certain benefits 
or adverse application of tax laws, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and 
financial condition.  
 
We are subject to various laws and regulations including the Information Technology Act, 2000, Information 
Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, Information Technology Financial Information for Fiscals 2021, 2022, 2023 and for the nine months ended December 31, 
2022 and December 31, 2023 have been derived from the: (i) audited interim consolidated financial statements of 
the group for the nine months ended D ecember 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023 each prepared in accordance 
with Ind AS 34, as prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act 2013 read with the Ind AS Rules; and (ii) 
audited consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and for the finan cial year ended March 31, 2021, 
March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023, each prepared in accordance with Ind AS, as prescribed under Section 133 
of the Companies Act 2013 read with the Ind AS Rules. The aforementioned financial statements have been 
restated in accordance with the SEBI ICDR Regulations and the ICAI Guidance Note. Ind AS differs in certain 
significant respects from Indian GAAP, IFRS, U.S. GAAP and other accounting principles with which prospective 
investors may be familiar in other countries. If o ur financial statements were to be prepared in accordance with 
such other accounting principles, our results of operations, cash flows and financial position may be substantially 
different. Prospective investors should review the accounting policies applie d in the preparation of our financial 
statements, and consult their own professional advisers for an understanding of the differences between these 
accounting principles and those with which they may be more familiar. Any reliance by persons not familiar w ith 
Indian accounting practices on the financial disclosures presented in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus should be 
limited accordingly.  
 
79.  The determination of the Price Band is based on various factors and assumptions and the Offer Price of 
the Equity Shares may not be indicative of the market price of the Equity Shares after the Offer. Further, 
the current market price of some securities l isted pursuant to certain previous issues managed by the 
BRLMs is below their respective issue prices.  
 
The determination of the Price Band is based on various factors and assumptions, and will be determined by our 
Company in consultation with the BRLMs. Furthermore, the Offer Price of the Equity Shares will be determined 
by our Company in consultation with the BRLMs through the Book Building Process. These will be based on 
numerous factors, including factors as described in the section “ Basis for Offer Price ” on page  144 and may not 
be indicative of the market price for the Equity Shares after the Offer.  
 
In addition to the above, the current market price of securities listed pursuant to certain previous initial public 
offerings managed by the BRLMs is below their respective issue price. For further details, see “ Other Regulatory 
and Statutory Disclosures – Price information of past issues handled by the BRLMs ” on page 447. The factors 
that could affect the market price of the Equity Shares include, among others, broad market trends, financial 
performance and results of our Company post -listing, and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you 
that an active market will develop or sustained trading will take place in the Equity Shares or provide any 
assurance regarding the price at which the Equity Shares will be traded after listing.  
 
80. QIBs and Non -Institutional Investors are not permitted to withdraw or lower their Bids (in terms of 
quantity of Equity Shares or the Bid Amount) at any stage after the submission of their Bid, and Retail 
Individual Investors are not permitted to withdraw t heir Bids after closure of the Bid/ Offer Closing Date.  
 
Pursuant to the SEBI ICDR Regulations, QIBs and Non -Institutional Investors are required to pay the Bid Amount 
on submission of the Bid and are not permitted to withdraw or lower their Bids (in terms of quantity of Equity 
Shares or the Bid Amount) at any s tage after submitting a Bid. Retail Individual Investors can revise their Bids Risk Factors – Any variation in the utilisation of the Net Proceeds would be subject to certain compliance

Assumptions for our estimated working capital requirements  - Justification for holding period levels  
 
Our Company’s expected working capital requirements are based on certain key assumptions and justifications as 
set forth below.  
 
Particulars  Assumptions and Justification  
Trade 
receivables  Holding levels of trade receivable for the Company varied between 8 -18 days for the Financial Years 
ended March 31, 2022, March 31, 2023 and n ine months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 
2023 with  an unusual year for Financial Year ended March 31, 2021 due to a large amount recoverable 
from an ex business partner. Our Company expect the trade receivables days to stay in the current range 
of 19 -20 days, going forward.  
Other current 
assets  The key items under this head are advances to suppliers, balances with government authorities, prepaid 
expenses and tax/other recoverable from suppliers. The average days for the Financial Years ended 
March 31, 2022, March 31, 2023 and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023 
were in range of 65 -77 days except for Financial Year ended March 31, 2021 which is unusual due to 
the impact of COVID -19. Our Company expects other current assets to normalize between 64 -72 days, 
going forward.  
Trade payable  Our Company’s trade payables have varied between 30 -53 days for the periods Financial Year ended 
March 31, 2021, Financial Year ended March 31, 2022, Financial Year ended March 31, 2023 and nine 
months ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Our Company expects the trade payables 
days to stabilise at 32 days, going forward.  
Other current 
liabilities  The key items under this head are advances from customers, customer refunds, employee payable and 
statutory liabilities apart from other miscellaneous current liabilities. The average days for this has been 
in the range of 39 -47 days for the Financial Years ended March 31, 2022, March 31, 2023 and nine 
months ended December 31, 202 3 and December 31, 2022. In Financial Year ended March 31, 2021, Risk Factors – We propose to utilize 
a portion of the Net Proceeds to undertake inorganic growth for which the target may not be identified. In the 
event that our Net Proceeds to be utilised towards inorganic growth initiatives are insufficient for the cost of 
our propo sed inorganic acquisition, we may have to seek alternat ive forms of funding. ” on page 50. 
 
(b) General corporate purposes   
 
The Net Proceeds will first be utilized for the each of the other o bjects as set out in this section. Subject to this, 
our Company intends to deploy any balance left out of the Net Proceeds towards general corporate purposes, as 
approved by our management, from time to time, subject to (i) such utilization for general corporate purposes not 
exceeding 25% o f the Gross Proceeds, and (ii) the cumulative amount to be utilized for general corporate purposes Risk Factors” and “Our Business – Our Strengths”  on pages 30 and 223, respectively.  
II. Quantitative Factors  
Certain information presented below relating to our Company is based on or derived from the Restated Financial 
Statements. For details, see “Financial Statements ” on page 288. 
Some of the quantitative factors which may form the basis for calculating the Offer Price are as follows:  
1. Basic and diluted earnings per Equity Share (“EPS”):  
As derived from the Financial Statements:  
Financial Year ended  Basic EPS (₹)  Diluted EPS (₹)  Weight  
March 31, 2023   0.58  0.57 3 
March 31, 2022   (0.66)   (0.66)  2 
March 31, 2021   0.25   0.25  1 
Weighted Average   0.11   0.11   
Nine months ended December 31, 2023* 1.80   1.75  
Nine months ended December 31, 2022* 0.46 0.45  
* Not annualised.  
 
Notes:  
Both basic EPS and diluted EPS have been calculated in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) 33 (earnings 
per share). The face value of Equity Shares of our Company is ₹1.  
1. The ratios have been computed as below:  
a. Basic earnings per share (₹) = Restated Net profit/loss attributable to equity shareholders / weighted average number of 
shares outstanding during the year.  
b. Diluted earnings per share (₹) = Restated Net profit/loss attributable to equity shareholders / weighted average number 
of dilutive equity shares  
2. The weighted average basic and diluted EPS is a product of basic and diluted EPS and respective assigned weight, dividing 
the resultant by total aggregate weight.  
3. Weighted average number of equity shares is the number of equity shares outstanding at the beginning of the year adjusted by 
the number of equity shares issued during the year multiplied by the time weighting factor. The time weighting factor is the 
number  of days for which the specific shares are outstanding as a proportion of total number of days during the year.  
4. For Fiscal 2022, employee stock option were excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted average number of ordinary

those of its subsidiaries. For this purpose, income and expenses of the subsidiary are based on the 
amounts of the assets and liabilities recognised in the consolidated financial statements at the 
acquisition date.  
 
(b) Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of the parent’s investment in each subsidiary and the parent’s 
portion of equity of each subsidiary. Business combinations policy explains how to account for any 
related goodwill.  
 
(c) Eliminate in full intra group  assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating 
to transactions between entities of the  Group (profits or losses resulting from intra group  transactions 
that are recognised in assets, such as inventory and fixed assets, are eliminated in full). Intra group  
losses may indicate an impairment that requires recognition in the Restated consolidated summary 
statements . Ind AS 12 Income Taxes applies to temporary differences that arise from the elimination 
of profits and losses resulting from intra group  transactions.  
 
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the equity 
holders of the parent of the Group and to the non -controlling interests, even if this results in the non -
controlling interests having a deficit balance. When  necessary, adjustments are made to the Restated 
consolidated summary statements of subsidiary to bring their accounting policies into line with the 
Group’s accounting policies. All intra group  assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash 
flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.

nor an interest in a joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and 
operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.  
An investment in an associate is accounted for using the equity method from the date on which the 
investee becomes an associate.  
 
Under the equity method, the investment in an associate is initially recognised at cost. The carrying 
amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s share of the profit or loss and 
other comprehensive income of the associate since  the acquisition date. Distributions received from an

whole.
Level 1: This level of hierarchy includes financial assets that are measured by reference to quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
Level 2: This level of hierarchy includes financial assets that are measured using inputs, other than quoted prices included within level 1, that are observable for such items, directly or indirectly. 
Level 3:This level ofhierarchy includes items measured using a valuation model based onassumptions that are neither supported byprices from observable current market transactions inthe same instruments nor based on
available market data.

our use of the impugned trademark “IXIGO” and the domain name “www.ixigo.com”, which are

jurisdiction, against which, our Company preferred commercial appeal before the Division Bench 
of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay. Pursuant to order dated September 14, 2017, the 
Divis ion Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay dismissed our commercial appeal as not 
maintainable. Subsequently, our Company filed a special leave petition before the Supreme Court 
of India in 2017 seeking leave to appeal against the order dated Sept ember 14, 2017 passed by the 
Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay. Subsequently, an insolvency petition 
against Ezeego One Travel and Tours Limited filed by Yes Bank Limited, as financial creditor, for
